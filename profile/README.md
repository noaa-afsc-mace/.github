# NOAA/NMFS Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering
The Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering Program combines midwater trawl surveys with acoustic echo integration technology to assess the population status of Alaska walleye pollock.  Pollock stocks support the largest single commercial fishery in the United States. We also collect data on Pacific hake stocks in the North Pacific and Bering Seas. Research is also conducted on fishing gear performance and fish behavior during the capture process in order to develop methods to reduce bycatch in commercial fishing operations.
